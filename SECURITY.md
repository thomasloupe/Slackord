## Reporting a Vulnerability

Visit our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/yccMweYPN8) and open a ticket from the bottom of the `#welcome-and-rules` channel.

Vulnerabilities will first be confirmed. If a vulnerability is confirmed, you can expect updates immediately throughout the resolution process privately in the Discord ticket created.
