# Frequently Asked Questions

## General questions     

### Q: I am getting a warning about max thread limits. What do I need to do?
A: You will have to close threads manually once you know there won't be any additional messages being posted to that thread. To do this effectively, on the top-left of your Discord guild's server, click the dropdown caret, and select `Active Threads`. Find a thread or threads you want to close, right-click the thread in the list and select `Close Thread`. This will close the thread out and give you one extra thread that can be created on your server. I have created an enhancement request to Discord's thread handling to allow applications like Slackord to programmatically close threads so Slackorders (a user or users of Slackord) don't have to manually do this. Please upvote it [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/6703) and write a supporting message in the thread for the enhancement. Discord is likely to pay more attention to requests with more upvotes and active discussion.

### Q: I am having issues with Slackord, what should I do?
A: Please post an [issue on Github](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord/issues) or join the community Discord, but please first read the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord2/wiki/Troubleshooting).     

### Q: Why don't you call your tool "SlackLord"?
A: See the [glossary](./glossary.md) for the meaning of Slackord.

### Q: Where can I find documentation?
A: We have a dedicated directory `docs` in the root of the github repo containing:
- [glossary](./glossary.md)
- This FAQ

### How do I get started with Slackord?
A: The [README](../README.md) traditionally is home to the installation and configuration *howto*

## Q: How do I contribute to Slackord?
A: If you'd like to contribute to Slackord, you can raise an issue about the contribution, then create a PR and link it to your issue for review.

### Q: I see repeating questions in Discord, can I assist answering them?
A: Yes, feel free to do so within the Discord code of conduct. **You can point straight to the FAQ** for repeating questions with a link.

### Q: I see "The application did not respond" in the Discord client. What's wrong?
A: This is an automated timeout in discord and generally can be ignored. It may also indicate that the local Slackord client cannot be contacted - make sure it's still running. 

### Q: What causes Rate Limiting messages in the Slackord app, what's happening?
A: You can safely ignore this. This is rate limiting on the Discord API, caused by traffic on the API itself. The Slackord client retries automatically.
