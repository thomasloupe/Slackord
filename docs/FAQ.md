# Frequently Asked Questions

## General questions     

### Q: I am getting a warning about max thread limits. What do I need to do?
A: You will have to close threads manually once you know there won't be any additional messages being posted to that thread. To do this effectively, on the top-left of your Discord guild's server, click the dropdown caret, and select `Active Threads`. Find a thread or threads you want to close, right-click the thread in the list and select `Close Thread`. This will close the thread out and give you one extra thread that can be created on your server. I have created an enhancement request to Discord's thread handling to allow applications like Slackord to programmatically close threads so Slackorders (a user or users of Slackord) don't have to manually do this. Please upvote it [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/6703), and write a supporting message in the thread for the enhancement so that Discord sees interest in the request.

### Q: I am having issues with Slackord, what should I do?
A: Please post an [issue on Github](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord/issues) or join the community Discord, but please first read the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord2/wiki/Troubleshooting).
